# ElMaram Project

### This the website we are working on
### Still under construction

# Little guide on how we plan to work together :
Go to your terminal and type :

`git clone https://github.com/Hacker035Tz/ElMaram-Website/tree/main <your directory>`

and when you complete your changes

```bash
git add <certain files or . to choose all>
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

Good Luck!
