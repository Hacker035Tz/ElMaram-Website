# ElMaram Project

### This the website we are working on
### Still under construction

# Little guide on how we plan to work together :
Go to your terminal and type :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hacker035Tz/ElMaram-Website <your directory>
```
You might enter your username and your PAT token, to do that see this video :

At time 1:03

and when you complete your changes

```bash
git add <certain files or . to choose all>
git commit -m "your message"
git push https://github.com/Hacker035Tz/ElMaram-Website master
```

Good Luck!
